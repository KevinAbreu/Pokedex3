<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>To be honest, I want to be hard on myself on this project since I believe I won't pass this class if this is not complete, but on the other hand, I feel a sense of pride for even making it so far in this project in the first place. Though I feel bad that I wasn't able to understand classes until the last minute, especially implementing it in the XHR. My goal is to stop over complicating things so I can do things to the best of my ability like I did in Mod 1. I know I have it in me, I just got to stop thinking that everything is more complicated than what it already is. </p>
